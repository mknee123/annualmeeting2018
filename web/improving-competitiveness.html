            <p>The passage of PA House Bill 1419, or “Clean Slate” legislation, “Clean Slate” is an important step in addressing the Pittsburgh region’s workforce challenge while expanding economic inclusion to all of our communities. The bill provides for automatic sealing of criminal records for certain individuals with misdemeanor convictions, allowing potential employers to look past minor mistakes and focus on the qualifications of the individual.</p>
            <p>A key piece of legislation – HB163 – passed the house and is ready to move in the Pennsylvania senate. This bill would reform the policy of suspending driver’s licenses for minor offenses, which serves as a barrier to employment and reduction in quality of life. This issue has bipartisan support and would improve the economic future of many.</p>

            <p>An increase to the NAP tax credit – which provides long-term sustainable support for locally-based revitalization organizations in low income neighborhoods – is nearly a reality.  In 2018, the legislation moved closer to passing than ever before. While HB645 successfully passed through the house, it needs a final push to pass the senate. This would increase the “NAP cap” from $18 million to $36 million, providing critical funding to supporting and improving our most vulnerable communities.</p>

          <p>Collaborating with partners across the Pittsburgh region, we were a key partner in organizing the Rail~Volution Conference in October. A national conference that assembles transportation infrastructure thought leaders in a place to share ideas, Rail~Volution offered the Pittsburgh region a platform to hone strategies and influence policies in the public transportation, transit-oriented development, placemaking and community development fields.</p>

            <p>We successfully advocated for a fix to legislation from Pennsylvania Department of Revenue’s that made PA’s business environment less competitive. Specifically regarding “bonus depreciation,” we worked with partners across the Commonwealth to change a policy and allow Pennsylvania businesses to deduct depreciation of a purchased asset before it’s sold or disposed. We prevented PA from being the only state moving forward with this type of tax policy.</p>

Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, now known as the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, was reauthorized</a>. The reauthorization of this legislation will help train the current and future workforce in demand in the Pittsburgh region. </p>
            <p>This past year, we increased our efforts to retain and attract talent. We partnered with Thrival to capitalize on the tech talent audience in town for the innovation conference; we armed presidents from 18 regional colleges and universities with talking points about the region and a call to stay upon graduation; and we provided career services offices with information highlighting off campus amenities in the region.</p>
